In this file, I take notes of features of Surge that I miss.

-Routing #CC74 to the cutoff frequency. This is the single most important sound control for most 
 patches I want to make. CC74 must control the filter's cutoff frequency - that's a standard thing 
 for me to do but seems impossible due to CC74 being "reserved" and I don't understand what that 
 means. Yes - I *want* to use CC74 to control the "brightness" - as in filter cutoff - that's 
 exactly what I want - but it seems to be impossible. It seems like the intention of "reserving"
 CC74 is specifically to use it for things like filter cutoff. It's like CC74 is *reserved* for 
 cutoff (and similar things) and therefore it *cannot* be routed to cutoff. What?!

-Filter keytrack seems to be possible only in Hz - but doesn't seem to be useful to me. It needs to 
 be in semitones such that the filter cutoff can be played musically by the midi notes. A keytrack
 of 100% should mean: the cutoff goes up by a factor of 2 between notes that are an octave apart. 
 It also means the cutoff goes up by a semitone between successive keys. 50% would mean the cutoff 
 goes up by a factor of sqrt(2) for notes that are an octave apart.
 Ah - OK - I see: The keytracking actually behaves correctly - it's just a bit awkward to set up:
 It's set up in Hz and if you set the keytrack in Hz to exactly the same value as the cutoff (which
 is also in Hz), then you get the right "keytrack = 100%" behavior. So maybe to exactly dial in a 
 100% keytrack, it's best to temporarily set the cutoff to 100 Hz, then set up keytrack to 100 and 
 then set the cutoff to where you want it to be.
