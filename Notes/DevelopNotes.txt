This file contains some notes that I take for the workflows for contributing to the Surge 
development. Such a file might be better placed into my fork of the actual Surge code repo, but for 
the time being, I don't want to litter it with that because I don't want it to becoem part of any
pull requests, so I keep it here.

Building Surge:

The readme file here:

  https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge

says that to build Surge, one should install git and Visual Studio. I always already do have that
installed on my develop machine anyway, so nothing to do here. Then, one should do 

  git clone https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge.git
  cd surge
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cmake -Bbuild
  cmake --build build --config Release --target surge-staged-assets

from the command line. If Powershell is installed, one can do Shift-Rightclick on an empty section 
in the surge folder content view in the Windows Explorer and the select 
"Open Powershell window here". What then remains it to enter the:

  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cmake -Bbuild
  cmake --build build --config Release --target surge-staged-assets

commands one after another. 

The first one: 

  git submodule update --init --recursive

may take a while and apparently downloads more stuff into the local copy of the repo (TODO: figure 
out what that stuff is and document it here!). The second one:

  cmake -Bbuild

fails with an error saying:

  "The term 'cmake' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable 
   program."

Hmm...but I do have cmake installed. Maybe the installer didn't set the PATH environment variable? 
But why would it not? OK - let's try something else: Open CMake-GUI, click "Browse Source..." 
button, navigate to the local copy of the repo, currently I have this here:

  C:\Users\rob\data\GitRepos\surge

and set the "Where to build the binaries" field to something like:

  C:/Users/rob/data/GitRepos/surge/build/vs19

then click the "Configure" button, confirm the popup dialog "Build directory does not exist. Should 
I create it?", select the appropriate generator (like Visual Studio 16 2019), keep using the default 
compilers and click "Finish". This takes a while and writes some messages into the bottom view. 
After it's done, the folder

  C:\Users\rob\data\GitRepos\surge\build\vs19

has been created and fille with some stuff and the middle view turns red and allows to select 
various options. Just leave that as is and click "Generate". Now, more files will be created - among 
them is the file:

  C:\Users\rob\data\GitRepos\surge\build\vs19\Surge.sln
