This file contains some notes that I take for the workflows for contributing to the Surge 
development. Such a file might be better placed into my fork of the actual Surge code repo, but for 
the time being, I don't want to litter it with that because I don't want it to becoem part of any
pull requests, so I keep it here.

Building Surge:

The readme file here:

  https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge

says that to build Surge, one should install git and Visual Studio. I always already do have that
installed on my develop machine anyway, so nothing to do here. Then, one should do 

  git clone https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge.git
  cd surge
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cmake -Bbuild
  cmake --build build --config Release --target surge-staged-assets

from the command line. If Powershell is installed, one can do Shift-Rightclick on an empty section 
in the surge folder content view in the Windows Explorer and the select 
"Open Powershell window here". What then remains it to enter the:

  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cmake -Bbuild
  cmake --build build --config Release --target surge-staged-assets

commands one after another. The first one may take a while and apparently downloads more stuff into
the local copy of the repo (TODO: figure out what that stuff is and document it here!). The second
one fails with an error saying:

  "The term 'cmake' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable 
   program."

Hmm...but I do have cmake installed.
