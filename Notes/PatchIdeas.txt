Electronic Bassdrums:
-Use a sum of 2 or 3 exp-shaped decay envelopes on th pitch
-Set them all to the same shape (exponential - not necessarily same curvature, though) and time and
 control their actual lengths with the "Rate" parameter and their influence with the "Amplitude"
 parameter of the the LFO. Set the mod-amount to maximum  (14 semitones). They should all be 
 unipolar (it's confusing otherwise)
-Maybe sort the envelopes by speed - slowest first.
-Use one MSEG for the amplitude. ADSR is not good enough - we need more control. So, set the ADSR to 
 neutral
-Maybe the formula modulator could be used to get an extended modulation range. It can output values
 greater than 1 easily, I hope. See here how to use it:

 ...hmm - well - it says, it ranges from -1 to +1 but maybe that's just the nominal range? Will it 
 be clipped? ...Nah! The values are clipped indeed! Not good! So, the formula modulator does not 
 help to extedn the modulation range. So maybe let's use MSEG 1 for the amplitude, MSEG 2 for filter
 cutoff and MSEG 3,4,5,6 for the pitch. Maybe when we add up 4 of them, we get enough cumulative 
 range? It's then 56 semitones in total
